[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
Ten damn days
And all I got to show for it is shoes, and shows, and chauffeurs with road rage
Still the same damn ad-lib: IGH!, old ways
Still got a letterman, no practice
Still got a burner, man, no lacking
Still outtin' Jams nigga, no Jackson
No Jordan and we toe-tagging
I'll take you to land, where the lake made of sand
And the milk don't pour and the honey don't dance
And the money ain't yours
Now it's just a red pill
Got a blue and a hand full of Advils
I'm the new Nitty, fuck it, Nitty the old me
So I'mma tell the buyer what Nitty told me

[Hook: Nate Fox]
I got that mmm, mmm
I got that God damn
I'm your pusha man
I'm your, I'm your pusha man
Pimp slappin', toe taggin'
I'm just tryna fight the man
I'm your pusha man
I'm your, I'm your pusha man
I got that mmm, mmm
I got that God damn
I'm your pusha man
I'm your, I'm your pusha man
Pimp slappin', toe taggin'
I'm just tryna fight the man
I'm your pusha man
I'm your, I'm your pusha man
Pimp slappin', toe taggin'
I'm just tryna fight the man
I'm your pusha man
I'm your, I'm your pusha man

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
You a laaaaaaaame, and your bitch break down my weed sometimes
See my face in the streets, in the tweets
And a Reader or a RedEye if you read Sun-Times
She got blisters on her knees, she's a fiend for the D
Even though I only beat one time
One time, it was one two times
It was two plus me equals threesome time
Shouts out to Nate, I jackball and I bop, I flex
Got neck from all these thots I sex
Rastafari them shottas, yes
House safari, mi casa, yes
Poppy fields of that popeye
She came to party, she popped a Molly
Said, "Come to papa", she said, "Papa, yes"

[Hook: Nate Fox]
I got that mmm, mmm
I got that God damn
I'm your pusha man
I'm your, I'm your pusha man
Pimp slappin', toe taggin'
I'm just tryna fight the man
I'm your pusha man
I'm your, I'm your pusha man
I got that mmm, mmm
I got that God damn
I'm your pusha man
I'm your, I'm your pusha man
Pimp slappin', toe taggin'
I'm just tryna fight the man
I'm your pusha man
I'm your, I'm your pusha man

[Hook: Chance The Rapper]
I've been riding around with my blunt on my lips
With the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip
Paranoia on my mind, got my mind on the fritz
But a lot of niggas dyin', so my 9 with the shits
I've been riding around with my blunt on my lips
With the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip
Paranoia on my mind, got my mind on the fritz
But a lot of niggas dyin', so my 9 with the shits

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
Move to the neighborhood; I bet they don't stay for good, watch
Somebody'll steal daddy's Rollie, call it the neighborhood watch
Pray for a safer hood when my paper good, watch
Captain Save-a-Hood, hood savior, baby boy
Still getting ID'd for Swishers (Mama still wash my clothes)
Still with the Save Money militia (I'mma still watch my bros)
Trapped in the middle of the map with a little-bitty rock and a little bit of rap
That, with a literary knack, and a little shitty Mac, and like literally jack

[Hook: Chance The Rapper]
I've been riding around with my blunt on my lips
With the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip
Paranoia on my mind, got my mind on the fritz
But a lot of niggas dyin', so my 9 with the shits
I've been riding around with my blunt on my lips
With the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip
Paranoia on my mind, got my mind on the fritz
But a lot of niggas dyin', so my 9 with the shits

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
They murking kids, they murder kids here
Why you think they don't talk about it? They deserted us here
Where the fuck is Matt Lauer at? Somebody get Katie Couric in here
Probably scared of all the refugees, look like we had a fuckin' hurricane here
They'll be shooting whether it's dark or not, I mean, the days is pretty dark a lot
Down here, it's easier to find a gun than it is to find a fucking parking spot
No love for the opposition, specifically a cop position
'Cause they've never been in our position
Getting violations for the nation, correlating, you dry snitchin'

[Hook: Chance The Rapper]
I've been riding around with my blunt on my lips
With the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip
Paranoia on my mind, got my mind on the fritz
But a lot of niggas dyin', so my 9 with the shits

[Breakdown: Chance The Rapper]
I know you scared
You should ask us if we scared too
I know you scared
Me too
I know you scared
You should ask us if we scared too
If you was there
Then we'd just knew you cared too

[Verse 3: Chance The Rapper]
It just got warm out, this the shit I've been warned 'bout
I hope that it storm in the mornin', I hope that it's pourin' out
I hate crowded beaches, I hate the sound of fireworks
And I ponder what's worse between knowing it's over and dyin' first
'Cause everybody dies in the summer
Wanna say your goodbyes, tell them while it's spring
I heard everybody's dying in the summer
So pray to God for a little more spring

[Breakdown: Chance The Rapper]
I know you scared
You should ask us if we scared too
If you was there
Then we'd just knew you cared too
